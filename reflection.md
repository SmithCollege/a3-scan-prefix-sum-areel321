## Reflection

In addition to the code, data, and graphs you should complete a short
written reflection on this process.
Answer the following questions:

## Deliverables

* Four implementations (single or seprate codes)
* Graph of results (can upload raw data, generations script)
* Runtime analysis (txt, pdf, etc)
* Reflection

* Peer feedback PR

## Extras

Implement the other advanced algorithm, either recursive doubling or
multiple kernels.
