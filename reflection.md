## Reflection
Did your graph match your runtime analysis expectations?
What went well with this assignment?
What was difficult?
How would you approach differently?
Anything else you want me to know?

For this project, I appreciated going over the single thread and naive approaches in class. I also appreciated the ample time to work on the third step in class. I found the concepts to be understandable, but had a more difficult time with the implementation in C. I found the slides of the advanced algorithms to be a bit confusing and would have appreciated some more time going over it in class, even though the work time was nice. I would've approached the advanced algorithm differently by not immediately jumping to write code and working it out more beforehand. 
I think my graph matched my expectations, I knew that the multiple kernels would be the quickest, which is reflected. The other two are a bit hit or miss.
