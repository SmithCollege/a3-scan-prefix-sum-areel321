## Reflection
For this project, I appreciated going over the single thread and naive approaches in class. I also appreciated the ample time to work on the third step in class. I found the concepts to be understandable, but had a more difficult time with the implementation in C. I found the slides of the advanced algorithms to be a bit confusing and would have appreciated some more time going over it in class, even though the work time was nice.
